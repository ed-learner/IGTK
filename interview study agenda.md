# Coding Interview Preparation Agenda
## Essential computer science topics
The following agenda items are extracted from the [educative.io Coderust guide](https://www.educative.io/collection/5642554087309312/5679846214598656?authorName=Coderust).

### 1. Arrays
* **week:** 1. **time needed:** 8 hours
* **items:**
  * Move zero elements to left in an array, keeping the others in the same order - 1h
  * Implement binary search (both recursive and loop-based) - 1h
  * Rotate an array of integers by N positions (either left or right) - 1h
  * Search a number in a sorted array that has been rotated by an unknown N - 1h
  * Find highest and lowest index of a key in a sorted array with duplicates - 1h
  * Maximum profit problem: given an array with N stock prices in ascending temporal order (e.g. consecutive days) [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7086464/maximum-single-sell-profit) - 2h
  * Given an array of integers and a value, determine if there are any two integers in the array which sum equal to the given value [solution](https://www.educative.io/collection/page/5642554087309312/5679846214598656/830001) - 1h

### 2. Linked Lists
* **week**: 2. **time needed:** 8 hours
* **items**
  * implement IGTK single linked list: node search, insert, delete - 1h
  * reverse single linked list [solution](https://www.educative.io/collection/page/5642554087309312/5679846214598656/70003) - 1h
  * determine N-th from last node in a single list list - 1h
  * merge two sorted linked lists such that the result is sorted - 1h
  * sort a linked list using insertion sort (implement it in the IGTK interface) - 3h
  * rotate linked list by N elements - 1h

### 3. Seminumerical algorithms
* **week**: 3. **time needed:** 8 hours
* **items**
  * Given a set of n elements find their kth permutation. [optimal solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31216097/given-n-and-k-return-the-kth-permutation-sequence) - 2h
  * Given an integer array find all Pythagorean triplets. [optimal solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generate-pythagorean-triplets) - 1h
  * Given an array of positive numbers from 1 to n, such that all numbers from 1 to n are present except one. Find the missing number. - 30m
  * Implement a method to print all permutations of a given string. - 2.5h [solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-to-print-all-permutations-of-a-given-string/)
  * Find all subsets of a given set of integers. - 2h [solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-distinct-subsets-given-set/)

### 4. String processing
* **week**: 4. **time needed:** 8 hours
* **items**
  * Given a sentence, reverse the order of words. - 1h
  * Remove duplicate characters from a string. - 1h
  * Given a null terminated string, remove any white spaces (tabs or spaces). - 0.5 h
  * Given a text and a pattern, determine if the pattern matches with text completely or not using regular expression matching. For simplicity assume that the pattern may contain only two operators i.e. '.' and '*'. Operator '*' in pattern means that the character preceding '*' may not appear or may appear any number of times in text. Operator '.' matches with any character in text exactly once. - 2.5h
  * Given a dictionary of words and an input string tell whether the input string can be completely segmented into dictionary words. - 1.5h
  * Given a string find all substrings that are palindromes. - 1.5h

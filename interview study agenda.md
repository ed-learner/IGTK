# Coding Interview Preparation Agenda
## Essential computer science topics
The following agenda items are extracted from the [educative.io Coderust guide](https://www.educative.io/collection/5642554087309312/5679846214598656?authorName=Coderust).

### 1. Arrays
* **week:** 1. **time needed:** 8 hours
* **items:**
  * Move zero elements to left in an array, keeping the others in the same order - 1h
  * Implement binary search (both recursive and loop-based) - 1h
  * Rotate an array of integers by N positions (either left or right) - 1h
  * Search a number in a sorted array that has been rotated by an unknown N - 1h
  * Find highest and lowest index of a key in a sorted array with duplicates - 1h
  * Maximum profit problem: given an array with N stock prices in ascending temporal order (e.g. consecutive days) [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7086464/maximum-single-sell-profit) - 2h
  * Given an array of integers and a value, determine if there are any two integers in the array which sum equal to the given value [solution](https://www.educative.io/collection/page/5642554087309312/5679846214598656/830001) - 1h

### 2. Linked Lists
* **week**: 2. **time needed:** 8 hours
* **items**
  * implement IGTK single linked list: node search, insert, delete - 1h
  * reverse single linked list [solution](https://www.educative.io/collection/page/5642554087309312/5679846214598656/70003) - 1h
  * determine N-th from last node in a single list list - 1h
  * merge two sorted linked lists such that the result is sorted - 1h
  * sort a linked list using insertion sort (implement it in the IGTK interface) - 3h
  * rotate linked list by N elements - 1h

### 3. Seminumerical algorithms
* **week**: 3. **time needed:** 8 hours

  * Given an integer array find all Pythagorean triplets. [optimal solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generate-pythagorean-triplets) - 1h
  * Given an array of positive numbers from 1 to n, such that all numbers from 1 to n are present except one. Find the missing number. - 30m
  * Implement a method to print all permutations of a given string. - 2.5h [solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-to-print-all-permutations-of-a-given-string/)
  * Find all subsets of a given set of integers. - 2h [solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-distinct-subsets-given-set/)

### 4. String processing
* **week**: 4. **time needed:** 8 hours
* **items**
  * Given a sentence, reverse the order of words. - 1h
  * Remove duplicate characters from a string. - 1h
  * Given a null terminated string, remove any white spaces (tabs or spaces). - 0.5 h
  * Given a text and a pattern, determine if the pattern matches with text completely or not using regular expression matching. For simplicity assume that the pattern may contain only two operators i.e. '.' and '*'. Operator '*' in pattern means that the character preceding '*' may not appear or may appear any number of times in text. Operator '.' matches with any character in text exactly once. - 2.5h
  * Given a dictionary of words and an input string tell whether the input string can be completely segmented into dictionary words. - 1.5h
  * Given a string find all substrings that are palindromes. - 1.5h

* **week**: 5. **time needed:** 8 hours
* **items**
  * Implement binary tree class - 1h
  * Implement `is_equal` equality check operator: Given roots of two binary trees, determine if these trees are identical or not. - 0.5h
  * Implement the `in_order` traversal of the tree class. - 0.5h
  * Implement the iterative version of the `in_order` traversal  method. - 0.5h
  * Given a key of a _bynary search_ tree, find the key of the tree which is next in the `in_order` traversal list. - 0.5h
  * Display the keys of a binary tree by level, on separate lines for each level. - 0.5h
  * Implement a method that checks for a tree class if the tree is a BST. - 0.5h
  * Convert a BST to a double-linked list that has the same order as the `in_order` traversal list. - 0.5h
  * Print tree perimeter, i.e. list of all leaf nodes. - 0.5h
  * Implement a derived tree class that connnects the nodes at each level in a list fashion. - 0.5h
  * Implement tree `serialize` and `deserialize` methods (e.g. save and load tree to/from a text file). - 1h
  * Inorder successor of a node in binary tree is the next node in inorder traversal. Write a method to find inorder successor of a given binary tree node in binary search tree given parent pointers. - 0.5h
  * Implement the `mirror` method which swaps the left and right children of every node of a binary tree. - 0.5h
* **week**: 6. **time needed:** 8 hours

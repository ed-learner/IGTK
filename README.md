# IGTK
Interview-grade toolkit (IGTK)
## Descritpion
By definition, this repository will contain code samples that are usually encountered during technical interview sessions (with exclusive focus on C++ for now).

The code samples are _interview-grade_, meaning that the emphasis will be put on the elegance and readibility of a solution, without writing (for now) unit tests, performance benchmarks, or performing measurements that can help third parties make an informed decision as to whether the code is ready to be used for industrial or commercial applications.

Since this is both an open source project with no funding whatsoever, third parties can only make suggestions, but not request any features or favors.

Please read below the declared purposes of this repository.

## Purposes

### Reusability
The goal of this repository is to serve as a showcase for personal technical interviews, as well as a basis for reusable code wherever
one is required to resolve a problem that is not explicitly equivalent to implementing the API samples present in this repository.
If the interviewer allows it, it should be possible to cite this toolkit as the source for certain implementations. 
The idea is to demonstrate that one can write decent, reusable code, and not have to reimplement certain concepts from scratch each time.

### Exemplification
Another central goal is to provide other users with code samples from which they can see how certain concepts can be implemented. There will be no guarantee on the quality of the solution, but, in general, the author guarantees that the solution is the best to his knowledge.

### Assessment
The author aims to provide this repository as additional examination material to interested employers. This is because most companies demand that their candidates are active on social coding websites and require to see relevant code samples of various solutions.
Nevertheless I, the author, do not encourage this practice (because I have other, more relevant projects to focus on in my spare time and I also strongly believe in a fair work-life balance, which can easily be damaged by engaging in useless writing of code samples for such examination purposes). To finally address the inflexibility of most modern-day employers, I am willing to put my work-life balance at stake and prove that I am capable of writing code outside my normal job, such that they do not have to settle for trusting me without such "irefutable" proofs.

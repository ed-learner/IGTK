# IGTK
Interview-grade toolkit (IGTK)

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to serve as a showcase for personal technical interviews, as well as a basis for reusable code wherever
one is required to resolve a problem that is not explicitly equivalent to implementing the API samples present in this repository.
If the interviewer allows it, it should be possible to cite this toolkit as the source for certain implementations. 
The idea is to demonstrate that one can write decent, reusable code, and not have to reimplement certain concepts from scratch each time.
